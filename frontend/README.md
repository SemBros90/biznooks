Frontend placeholder

This repo contains a backend prototype. Frontend scaffolding for invoices/reports should be added here (React + TypeScript recommended).

Suggested next steps:
- `npx create-react-app frontend --template typescript`
- Add routes: `/invoices`, `/journals`, `/reports`
- Use `fetch` or `axios` to call the backend API endpoints.
